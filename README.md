Hi there, 

Thanks for visiting my profile. I'm a data scientist interested in using my technical skills to troubleshoot and drive decision making. I'm currently job-hunting for data-oriented roles, so if there are any questions about my projects, please feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-ortega/).
When I'm not busy staring at my computer, I can be found at the gym, feeding my sourdough starter, or scouring the thrift store for turtleneck sweaters ðŸ˜¸
