Hi there, 

Thanks for visiting my profile. I'm a data analyst interested in using my technical skills to troubleshoot and drive decision making. I'm currently job-searching for roles, so if there are any questions about my projects, please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-ortega/).

When I'm not busy staring at my computer, I can be found at the gym, feeding my sourdough starter, or scouring the thrift store for turtleneck sweaters ðŸ˜¸
