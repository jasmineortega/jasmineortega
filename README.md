Plant biologist turned data scientist ðŸŒ±

Passionate about building data products. I recently made a foray into digital bullet journalling with [SheWoreWhat](https://sheworewhat.herokuapp.com/) ðŸŒˆ 

When I'm not at my computer, I can be found at the gym, feeding my sourdough starter, or scouring the thrift store for turtleneck sweaters :mag:
