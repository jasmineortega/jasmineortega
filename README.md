Hi there, 

Thanks for visiting my profile. I'm a data science student interested in using my technical skills to solve problems in the biotechnology sphere :seedling: :computer: 

My previous work experience is primarily in sustainable agriculture and food systems. I've done eveything from extracting plant DNA at laboratory benches to planting seeds in fields. Right now, I'm at the tail end of my Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. 

When I'm not busy with MDS homework, I can be found at the gym, feeding my sourdough starter, or scouring the thrift store for turtleneck sweaters. 

If there are any questions about my projects, please feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-ortega/)
